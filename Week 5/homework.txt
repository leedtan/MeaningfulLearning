For homework, please study how to organize Machine Learning into clean python code. Follow along https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-network-introduction-for-software-engineers-1611d382c6aa and try to implement a similar solution. For your solution, only implement linear regression, so use the same coding techniques, but implement linear regression rather than a neural network. If you have trouble remembering linear regression math (for instance, the math for how to update your paramters of a linear regression model), refer to Week 2.5 of this course on linear regression math.
